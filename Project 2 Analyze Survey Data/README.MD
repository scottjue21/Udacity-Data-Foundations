For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a presentation to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it - the questions leading to this page should have assisted in this process! Then you should use spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. This project is open-ended in that there is not one right answer.
