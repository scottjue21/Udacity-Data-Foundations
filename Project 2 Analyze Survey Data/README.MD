**Project Overview**<br>
In this project, you will analyze a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so it isn't perfect. It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing). You will need to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate your findings about it.

For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a presentation to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it - the questions leading to this page should have assisted in this process! Then you should use spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.
